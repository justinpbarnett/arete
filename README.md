# arete

Agent loops that keep running and keep making the harness they run in better.

Arete is one global engine for every repo on the machine. Each repo gets a thin layer that says how to set up, what checks must pass, and how much the agents are trusted there. The layer is `.agents/` in the repo, or a folder outside it when the rest of the team does not use arete. Agents edit files. Arete's own code commits, pushes and opens PRs, so no agent ever holds git write access.

## Loops

| Loop | Command | When | What it does |
|------|---------|------|--------------|
| 0 heartbeat | `arete heartbeat` | hourly | Checks launchd jobs, log freshness, real probe calls, claude login expiry, the event hook, and disk. Each failing check opens one issue on `alert_repo`; recovery closes it. |
| 1 miner | `arete mine` | nightly | Reads the day's Claude Code transcripts and hook events, finds corrections and repeated friction, and opens harness PRs (CLAUDE.md, skills, `.agents/`) in the repo where the fix belongs. |
| 2 auditor | `arete audit` | nightly | Deterministic checks of skills, hooks and `.agents` configs, plus skills that fail or never get used. |
| 3 pipeline | `arete poll`, `arete run REPO TICKET` | every 5 min | Tickets labeled `agent`, from GitHub issues or Jira, go through plan, build, checks, fix, review, learn, then a GitHub PR. |
| 4 evals | `arete eval REPO` | on demand, nightly | Runs `.agents/evals` tasks against a fixed commit and records the pass rate, so harness changes are measured, not guessed. |

The event hook (`arete hook`) records skill use, agent spawns, tool failures, denials, interrupts and API stop failures to `~/.local/share/arete/events.jsonl`. The miner and auditor read it. Register it in `~/.claude/settings.json` for `PostToolUse` (matcher `Skill|Agent|Task|Bash`), `PostToolUseFailure` (matcher `*`) and `StopFailure`, with the command `[ -x "$HOME/.local/bin/arete" ] && "$HOME/.local/bin/arete" hook || true` and a 10 second timeout. Every path through it exits 0, so it never fails a session.

## Layout

- Code: this repo, a uv project (Python pinned in `.python-version`, everything locked in `uv.lock`). Installed with `uv tool install --editable . --python 3.13`
- Config: `~/.config/arete/config.toml` (`arete init` writes a starting one)
- State: `~/.local/share/arete/` (sqlite, events, run logs, worktrees)
- Logs: `~/Library/Logs/arete/`
- Per repo: `config.toml`, `expertise.md` and `evals/` in the layer, `.agents/` in the repo or the folder that `layer` names

## Develop

`uv run arete status` runs from the checkout without the installed tool. `uv tool install --editable . --python 3.13 --force` refreshes the `arete` on PATH that launchd uses.

No runtime dependencies: stdlib only, so the tool install needs nothing from PyPI. Add one with `uv add`, never pip.

## Global config

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `alert_repo` | GitHub repo where each failing heartbeat check opens one issue. Bodies carry check names and a short status only. Until the repo exists, alerts fall back to macOS notifications. |
| `global_repo` | Name of the `[[repo]]` that holds global skills and settings. |
| `[models]` | Model per role: `plan`, `build`, `review`, `learn`, `miner`, `apply`, `probe`. |
| `[miner]` | `lookback_hours` and `max_digest_chars` for the nightly transcript digest. |
| `[[repo]]` | Every repo arete knows: `name`, `path`, `github`, and the fields below. |
| `[[job]]` | launchd jobs the heartbeat watches, by `label`. A `keepalive` job must have a pid; others must have last exited 0. `log` with `max_age_hours` flags a stale log. |
| `[[probe]]` | Real calls the heartbeat makes every `every_hours`: a `command` whose output must contain `expect`. A real call, because an auth check can say ready while real calls fail on an expired token. |
| `[jira]` | See [Jira tickets](#jira-tickets). |

| Repo field | Default | Meaning |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `pipeline` | `false` | Poll this repo's tickets and run the build pipeline. |
| `mine` | `true` | The miner may open harness PRs here. |
| `public` | `false` | PR bodies cite run ids, never transcript text. |
| `tracker` | `"github"` | `github` for issues in the repo, `jira` for tickets in Jira. PRs are on GitHub either way. |
| `jira_project` | `[jira] project` | Jira project for this repo. |
| `jira_label` | `repo-<github repo name>` | Route label that sends a Jira ticket to this repo. |
| `layer` | `<path>/.agents` | Folder that holds the repo's layer. Point it outside the repo to keep arete files out of a shared repo. |
| `[[repo.part]]` | none | One per git repo under `path`, for a product split over several repos: `dir` (relative to `path`) and `github`. See [Parts](#parts). |

## GitHub tickets

An open issue labeled `agent` that the repo owner opened. Issues labeled `bug` or `fix` are fixes; the rest are features. Arete tracks progress with `agent:running`, `agent:pr`, `agent:failed` and `agent:needs-info`, and the PR closes the issue. Remove `agent:failed` or `agent:needs-info` to send it back to the queue. `arete install` creates all of these labels in each GitHub pipeline repo, so `agent` is there to pick from any GitHub client, the phone app included.

## Jira tickets

```toml
[jira]
env_file = "~/.env"
project = "ABC"

[jira.transitions]
running = "In Progress"

[jira.landed]
staging = "UAT"
main = "Done"

[[repo]]
name = "web"
path = "~/dev/web"
github = "acme/web"
pipeline = true
tracker = "jira"
mine = false
```

`JIRA_BASE_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL` and `JIRA_API_TOKEN` come from the environment, else from `env_file`. `[jira.transitions]` moves tickets as the pipeline moves them: each of `running`, `pr`, `failed` and `needs-info` maps to a transition name or a target status name. A state left out only sets labels and comments. `[jira.landed]` moves a ticket once its merged PRs reach a branch, by the same kind of name. List branches in the order work travels: each poll moves the ticket to the last listed branch that holds the work of every PR, and never back. A branch holds a PR's work when it contains the merge commit, or when another PR naming the ticket key merged into it, as a port of the change to `main` does. With the table above, a PR merged into staging moves its ticket to UAT, and the release that brings staging into main moves it to Done. `arete jira-check` reads Jira with the token and counts the tickets waiting in each project.

A ticket runs when all of these hold:

- It carries `agent` plus exactly one route label, `repo-web` above.
- It is assigned to you and not Done.
- You added `agent` yourself, and nobody else has edited the summary or description since you last touched its labels.

Touching the labels is the approval: whatever the ticket says then, you have read. After it, only your own edits, comments and attachments reach the agent; other people's comments and attachments count only when added before the approval. Arete's own label edits go out under your token too, so they are told apart: they only swap `agent-*` state labels and always add one, and they never count as approval. Removing a state label to retry is your edit, so it approves the ticket as it reads now.

Progress shows as `agent-running`, `agent-pr`, `agent-failed` and `agent-needs-info`. Bug, Fire, Incident and Problem issue types are fixes, as are tickets labeled `bug` or `fix`. PR titles end with the key, like `Fix login (ABC-12)`, PR bodies link the ticket, and these PRs get no arete labels. Tickets the approval rules hold back, and tickets with a missing or doubled route label, show in `arete status` with the reason. `arete run REPO KEY --force` runs one anyway.

Image attachments go to the agents as files they can open, up to 6 images and 5 MB each. The rest are named in the prompt, not downloaded. A failed download fails the run without labels, so the next poll tries again.

## Per repo layer

```toml
[setup]
commands = ["pnpm install --frozen-lockfile"]
copy = [".env.local"]

[checks]
typecheck = "pnpm typecheck"
test = "pnpm test"

[limits]
max_diff_lines = 400
deny = ["drizzle/migrations/**", ".github/**"]
max_attempts = 3
timeout_minutes = 45

[agent]
allow_bash = ["pnpm *", "npx vitest*"]

[trust]
level = "pr"
automerge_after = 5

[git]
base = "main"
subject = "{kind}: {title}"
branch = "arete/{id}-{slug}"
```

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `setup.commands` | Run in each fresh worktree before the agent starts. |
| `setup.copy` | Files copied from the main checkout into each worktree. |
| `checks` | Every check must exit 0 before review. The agent may run them while it builds. |
| `limits` | Diff size, paths the change may not touch, fix attempts, and the run timeout. Code enforces them after the agent finishes. |
| `agent.allow_bash` | Bash patterns the agent may run, on top of read only git and file commands. |
| `trust.level` | `pr`, or `automerge` once earned. |
| `trust.automerge_after` | Merged PRs in a row before arete opens a PR proposing automerge. |
| `git.base` | Branch PRs target. Defaults to the GitHub default branch. |
| `git.subject` | Commit subject and PR title. Fields: `{kind}` (`feat` or `fix`) and `{title}`. The ticket ref is appended to the commit subject, like `(#35)` or `(ABC-12)`, and to a Jira PR title; a GitHub PR links its issue with `Closes #35` instead. |
| `git.branch` | Branch name. Fields: `{kind}`, `{id}` (`35` or `ABC-12`) and `{slug}` (the title in short url safe form). |

A template with an unknown field falls back to the default. A layer in `.agents/` that is not committed yet still works: runs read it from the main checkout and lessons land there, but arete never proposes automerge until it is committed. A layer outside the repo is read in place, lessons land in its `expertise.md`, and the miner leaves the repo's `.agents/` alone. Arete never proposes automerge for it: raise `trust.level` by hand.

## Parts

```toml
[[repo]]
name = "shop"
path = "~/dev/shop"
pipeline = true
tracker = "jira"
layer = "~/.config/arete/layers/shop"

[[repo.part]]
dir = "app/client"
github = "acme/shop-client"

[[repo.part]]
dir = "app/server"
github = "acme/shop-server"
```

A repo with parts takes no `github` of its own and needs `tracker = "jira"`. Each run gets one folder with a worktree per part at its `dir`, all on the same branch, and the checks run from that folder. Each part continues from its open PR on the branch, or from commits already pushed to the branch with no PR yet, else starts fresh from the base. A ticket can need several runs, and each run adds commits to the PRs already open; it keeps the branch of those PRs even when the ticket's title or type changes.

Arete commits and opens a PR only in the parts the change touched, and every PR body links the others. Before it pushes, it checks that no part's branch moved since the run started. If one did, it pushes nothing and says so on the ticket; remove `agent-failed` to run again on top of the new commits. The run counts as merged when all its PRs merge, and the run counts as rejected when they are all closed and one did not merge.

## Evals

A task is `evals/<name>.toml` in the layer:

```toml
title = "Recipes written in the library can carry a photo"
base = "4f1c2ab"
prompt = '''The task, written like an issue.'''
check = "pnpm vitest run src/lib/recipes/photo.test.ts"
timeout_minutes = 30
```

`base` is the commit to start from, the remote default branch when left out. Files in `evals/<name>/` are hidden from the agent and copied in only after it finishes, so a held out test decides pass or fail. Each task runs the pipeline's own plan, build and fix steps in a fresh worktree, with the harness (CLAUDE.md, skills, expertise) taken from the working copy, or from a git ref with `arete eval REPO --ref REF` to compare a harness PR against main. A layer outside the repo is read in place. Evals run on single repos, not on repos with parts.

## Rules

- Agents run through `claude -p` on a Claude subscription. Never the API SDK, never `--bare`.
- Agents never run git write commands. Diff size and deny paths are enforced by code after the agent finishes, not by asking nicely.
- Trust starts at `pr`. Automerge only arrives through a human: a config PR they merge, or for a layer outside the repo, their own edit to `trust.level`.
- Alert issues carry check names and one short status line, never log contents.
- PRs to public repos cite run ids, never transcript text.
